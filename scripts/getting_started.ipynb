    "# Welcome to the Quantum Computing 4 Africa Workshop \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re thrilled to have you join us for this exciting and hands-on introduction to quantum computing! Whether you're a student, researcher, developer, or industry profesional, this workshop is designed to give you practical exposure to one of the most revolutionary fields in technology today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will you learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The following labs will introduce you to the foundations of quantum computing using Python and the Qiskit framework. Throughout this workshop, you'll explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The basics of quantum gates and quantum circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploring the bloch sphere [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/composer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to build and run circuits on simulators and real quantum hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "- An introduction to quantum machine learning using the sklearn dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this introductory lab is to show you how to get started with quantum computing using Python. Quantum computers stand as a promising technology that promises to disrupt how some calculations are done. From breaking encryptation with Shor's algorithm, to enable faster searches with Grover's to even design better batteries with quantum phase estimation. However, when we think about these nice applications, we have to think as well about how to design and execute these algorithms. For many of us this tool is Qiskit! A software for design and implementation of quantum circuits in simulators and real hardware. We will the Qiskit library, which is one of the most popular quantum computing libraries in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "you will need Qiskit 2.0 and this notebook is going to provide you with the detailed instructions to get your machine ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "First you must check that the version of python you are using in your environment is python>=3.9.6, to make sure that it will be compatible with the latest Qiskit version we will use\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you can also find many useful resources on IBM's new page of quantum education [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/)."
